# Road Safety Data Analysis Overview

This repository presents a comprehensive analysis of the UK Department of Transportation's "Road Safety Data" using Apache PySpark, a distributed computing framework. The analysis spans from 2017 to 2021, covering road accidents, casualties, and involved vehicles.

## Key Analyses:
1. **Trends Over Time:**
   - Utilized PySpark to analyze and visualize trends in the total number of accidents over the years.
   - Discovered a decreasing trend in total accidents, with fluctuations based on specific conditions.

2. **Common Accident Types:**
   - Identified and visualized the top 10 most common accident types based on road types and severity.
   - Highlighted certain road types prone to accidents, aiding in prioritizing safety measures.

3. **Casualty Analysis:**
   - Explored the correlation between accidents and casualties, revealing a positive relationship.
   - Visualized the distribution of casualties, emphasizing the prevalence of zero or one casualty incidents.

4. **Weather Conditions Impact:**
   - Analyzed the correlation between weather conditions and accident rates.
   - Revealed that adverse weather conditions, such as rain and snow, significantly increased accident rates.

5. **Factors Affecting Accidents:**
   - Explored the impact of road surface conditions on accident severity.
   - Found wet and icy roads to significantly affect the severity of accidents.

6. **Pedestrian Crossing and Human Control:**
   - Analyzed accidents at pedestrian crossings controlled by humans.
   - Discovered that human-controlled crossings had fewer accidents, suggesting their effectiveness.

7. **Day and Time Analysis:**
   - Visualized the number of accidents based on days of the week and times of the day.
   - Identified patterns, such as higher accident frequencies during weekdays and rush hours.

8. **Speed Limitation Impact:**
   - Analyzed the correlation between accident severity and speed limits.
   - Found higher speed limits associated with increased accidents with fatal and serious injuries.

## Conclusion:
The PySpark analysis highlights key factors influencing road safety, providing insights for policymakers. The comprehensive nature of the dataset, along with PySpark's capabilities, allowed for a nuanced examination of trends and correlations. This work serves as a valuable resource for understanding and enhancing road safety measures.
